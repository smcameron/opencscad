<p>Opencscad is a very tiny little library that helps you
produce OpenSCAD programs by writing in C.  In this way, you
get real variables and recursion, which aren't available in
plain OpenSCAD. <b>Note: Openscad does have recursion, and has had
recursion for a long time now, though it didn't back when I wrote this
thing a long time ago. Openscad has acquired a load of other new features
as well since then, so my little program is probably not really all that
useful anymore.</b>
<p>You can get opencscad here:
